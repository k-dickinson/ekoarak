Ekoarak is a social music practice platform that uses advanced audio processing to transform any MP3 into an interactive musical experience. The system automatically separates uploaded MP3 files into distinct vocal and instrumental tracks using Spleeter.separator, then converts the isolated vocal track into MIDI data by analyzing pitch frequencies and timing with Librosa. This MIDI data is subsequently transformed into MusicXML format using Partitura, enabling the generation of readable sheet music that displays the song's melody line. The platform synchronizes the visual sheet music with playback of the separated instrumental track, allowing musicians to read and play along with the melody while hearing the full backing music, creating a karaoke style practice environment where players can jam along with their favorite songs in real time.
